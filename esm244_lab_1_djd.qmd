## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

For this class we will be using Quarto instead of Rmarkdown because you can have the same functionality as RMarkdown but you don't need R to open a Quarto document.

In addition you can switch between visual and source panes. Visual pane will show you what your output document will look like.
